The font-family property specifies the font for an element.
The font-family property can hold several font names as a "fallback" system. If the browser does not support the first font, it tries the next font.
There are two types of font family names:
family-name - The name of a font-family, like "times", "courier", "arial", etc.
generic-family - The name of a generic-family, like "serif", "sans-serif", "cursive", "fantasy", "monospace".
Start with the font and always end with a generic family, to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available.</td>
